 * This file is required for the plugin to be loaded. Within this index file, you are able to include other files as normal. 
 * This file is a blank example of what you can do. 
 * 
 * Be sure you have created your plugins folder by naming it the same as your plugin (If there are spaces, please include "-" within the space.
 * For example "My-Example-Plugin")
 * 
 * This will ensure that the plugin is loaded properly. 
 * 
 * If you want to disable the plugin, be sure to include a "_" at the start of the folder name, for example:
 * "My-Example-Plugin" would become "_My-Example-Plugin"
 * This will disable the plugin from being loaded.
 * 
 * You are welcome to delete this example plugin within the plugins folder.
